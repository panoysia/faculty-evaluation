# Description
This app is an online implementation of the manual faculty profiling and evaluation process done by most local state universities in the Philippines.

Basically, think of this as a semi-HR application catered to faculty members. This app has CRUD capabilities for basic HR features like leaves management and employee/faculty profiling.

Originally, this app started as a project proposal of my friend who works in a local state university near my hometown [Iloilo City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iloilo_City). **I volunteered in kind to develop it so that I can practice and apply my Ruby and Ruby on Rails skills in real world scenarios.**

## Reasons for sharing
I shared it publicly here in GitHub for a number of reasons:

  1. To let prospective employers see it as my code portfolio<br>
***(I'm currently looking for work opportunities as a web developer, preferably using Ruby/Rails)***

  2. To let other programmers see it and maybe gain feedback in return
  3. To look back someday on how far I've improved my skills
    *(comparing how I code in the past versus how I code in the present)*

  4. Proof that I started coding in Rails even if my code is still crappy and requires improvement (proud of it!)

## Usage
Using and browsing this app requires authentication. Since this is being used currently (Jul 2017), I only want to give access to prospective employers so that they can look and browse around the app.

## Future Plans
I'll continue to update and refactor this application as I continue to get better at my craft. Maybe I can create another repository of a better version of this. There's a lot of work to be revised here.
